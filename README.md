# Linear Algebra Lab
An interactive demo of concepts in linear algebra.

The demo currently [live on GitHub Pages](https://BAAARCODE.github.io/linalg-lab) uses a full-screen HTML canvas to draw a linear combination of two 2D vectors, rendering a corresponding equation in KaTeX as the vectors change.

## Hotkeys
* **SPACE:** Toggle mouse movement of target vector (w)
* **U:** Toggle mouse movement of blue vector (u)
* **V:** Toggle mouse movement of orange vector (v)

## Roadmap
- [ ] Improve reusability of JavaScript code
- [ ] Create home page
- [ ] Include more demonstrations
  - [ ] Determinant of a matrix
  - [ ] Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  - [ ] Vector dot product and projection
