# Linear Algebra Lab
An interactive demo of concepts in linear algebra.

The current demo uses a fullscreen HTML canvas to draw a linear combination of two 2D vectors, rendering a corresponding equation in KaTeX alongside the 

## Hotkeys
* **SPACE:** Toggle mouse movement of target vector (w)
* **U:** Toggle mouse movement of blue vector (u)
* **V:** Toggle mouse movement of orange vector (v)
